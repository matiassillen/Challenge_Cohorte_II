The primary objective of this final project was to apply all the knowledge acquired during the course. I conducted automated testing on the website www.saucedemo.com using two specific user accounts: "standard_user" as User 1 and "problem_user" as User 2. This testing aimed to evaluate the functionality and performance of the site under different user conditions, ensuring reliability and robustness.

The project involved:
- Developing a comprehensive test plan covering various user interactions and scenarios.
- Implementing test scripts to automate the testing process using Cypress.
- Analyzing and documenting the test results to identify any issues or improvements.
- Preparing a detailed test report to summarize the findings, conclusions, and recommendations for future improvements.

The automated testing process helped streamline the quality assurance of the website, providing valuable insights into potential areas for enhancement.
